Hi, I'm Zeshan Musawar, a skilled Mobile Application Developer with over 5 years of experience building high-performance apps for iOS, Android, and cross-platform (Flutter). I specialize in native iOS development using Swift/SwiftUI, native Android using Kotlin, and Flutter for building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly mobile solutions.

I've collaborated with startups and SaaS platforms to deliver apps that are secure, intuitive, and aligned with business goals. From AI integrations and API connectivity to publishing apps on both the App Store and Google Play, I offer complete end-to-end mobile development with clean architecture and modern UI/UX practices.
